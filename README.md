In the world of board games, Goban, also known as Go or Weiqi, is a
venerable and intellectually profound pastime with a rich history
spanning centuries. As an abstract strategy board game, Goban boasts
a simple rule set, yet it unfurls a vast and intricate space of possible
strategies. This complexity makes it an ideal candidate for the
exploration of mutual exclusion principles in a Python-based
implementation.
The principle of mutual exclusion, a fundamental concept in
concurrent computing, refers to the practice of preventing multiple
processes from accessing a shared resource simultaneously to prevent
data inconsistencies and race conditions. This project adapts the
principles of mutual exclusion to Goban to ensure a fair and
unobstructed gaming experience.
This extended abstract provides an overview of our Python
implementation of the Goban game, emphasizing the integration of
mutual exclusion concepts and its implications for the gameplay.
